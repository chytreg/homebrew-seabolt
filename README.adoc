= Homebrew tap for Neo4j seabolt

Tap and install with

```
brew install monterail/homebrew-seabolt/seabolt
```

Afterwards, `seabolt-cli` is available on the path and you can run queries like this:

```
BOLT_PASSWORD=secret seabolt-cli run "UNWIND range(1, 23) AS n RETURN n"
```

The library can also be used for developing with Go using the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver[Neo4j Go Driver].
